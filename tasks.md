## `Regular` Mode

Just message sending to given channels

## Webhooks

The host/GM would have a `[Host]` tag, the bot itself uses `[System]` and messages sent by constellations use either `[Messenger]` or a bird for message deliveries, or `<Pending>`.

## Database

Gotta store some information and shit for `OSV` Mode.

## `Omniscient Sellout's Viewpoint` Mode

Much more features.

## Website

A website which allows the hosts to act, likely only active in `Omniscient Sellout's Viewpoint` mode.
